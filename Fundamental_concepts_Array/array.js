/*

An Array is an object type designed for storing data collections.

Key characteristics of JavaScript arrays are:

-> Elements: An array is a list of values, known as elements.

-> Ordered: Array elements are ordered based on their index.

-> Zero indexed: The first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.

-> Dynamic size: Arrays can grow or shrink as elements are added or removed.

-> Heterogeneous: Arrays can store elements of different data types (numbers, strings, objects and other arrays).
