/**
 ** What are Functions?
    => Functions are fundamental building blocks in all programming.
    => Functions enable better code organization, modularity, and efficiency.
    => Functions are reusable block of code designed to perform a particular task.
    => Functions execute when they are "called" or "invoked".

 ** Why Functions?
    => With functions you can reuse code
    => You can write code that can be used many times.
    => You can use the same code with different arguments, to produce different results.
